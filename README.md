# Boring Bingo

A Godot 4.x implementation of bingo.

The goal is to practice:
- networking skills
- dynamic UI (ticket generation)

## About the game
This bingo is following the style of the "pink bingo slips". That is, rather than just an NxN ticket, we have a ticket with 6 grids of 9 columns by 3 rows. Numbers 1-9 are placed in column 1 across all grids, numbers 10-19 are placed in column 2, etc. The final column (column 9) contains numbers 80-89, but additionally, number 90.
